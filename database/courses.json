The course is focused on developing the essential technical skills that will allow a student to develop a functional web application project. The course takes students through the UX design process which includes creating and administering surveys & interviews, creating personas and user stories, designing wireframes, and performing user tests with a developed implementation that is based on the UX design process. Students will use the Agile methodology to manage the software process. Software management workflow also includes using Git from the command-line for version control basics in a collaborative workflow. Students will apply web technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Data persistence may be optionally achieved using NoSQL data technology solution.",

    "description": "Business Analysis and Systems Design is the study of concepts, processes and tools that professionals use to plan and develop information systems to industry standards. Students learn how to ask implicit questions, to create and document communication plans and to make better decisions prior to creating a software system. Beginning with an introduction to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), students work in teams to initiate the system process, analyze problems, discover requirements and create a logical design. Topics include: techniques used in the discovery of business requirements, traditional approaches to data and process modelling, entity-relationship diagrams, and an introduction to relational database normalization. Agile life cycles such as Scrum are also introduced and compared to more planned life cycles such as waterfall. By the end of this course, successful participants will be able to use tools and methods commonly used in industry to analyze, design, and implement information systems as confirmed by a term project.",
